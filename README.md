COMMON QUESTIONS/ANSWERS

Q: why does my strums work as the same button?

A: you are likely using guitar config/santroller this isnt a issue with the input display its a issue with how these controllers bind strums to the same hat switch.. i suggest using the code listed on my github.

Q: why are all the buttons nonstop pressed?

A: you have not calibrated the controller.. press the "+" key on your keyboard and then after red text disappears you con proceed to bind you buttons.
