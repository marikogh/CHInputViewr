hi i present to you the input viewer you have all been asking for and bitching about being gatekept. as you know the build that got leaked had its issues like for example ips being calculated oddly. the ips is better in this build but the issues some have had with certain guitars have not been resolved. with that said if you have any issues like for example both strums mapping to just one please PLEASE DO NOT ask me(mari) or grimtin how to fix this issue. the only ways around this is not using guitar configurator and using other code for your arduinotars or us rewriting the entire project. we would like to fix these issues and go about the project in a different way in the future but not yet.
